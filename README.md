10K 3D Canvas
=============

A 3D rotating cube I whipped up for a 10K JavaScript contest in August of 2010, which I never submitted. I always
wanted to code something in 3D so once I managed to get it working, the excitement of competing wore off and I didn't
bother submitting it. It's only 6.9K and 1.9K minified, so I'm sure I could bring it down to 1K for a 1K competition,
if I cared enough to compete. :)

I should mention that [Mo Kakwan](https://github.com/wavewash) helped me out with the math.
